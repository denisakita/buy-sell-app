# Angular Full-Stack Project

Welcome to the Angular Full-Stack Project! This project is designed to help you learn how to build a full-stack Angular-powered website from scratch. In this project, we'll be creating an Angular 17 front end and writing a back end in Node.js using hapi. We'll also add PostgreSQL to our back end, connect the front and back ends, add Firebase Authentication to our project, and finally, deploy our full-stack application to the cloud.
